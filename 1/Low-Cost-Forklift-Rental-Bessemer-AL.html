YaleÂ® trucks are manufactured in an ISO 9001:2008 registered facility and range in capacity from 2,000 to 36,000 lbs.</p>

<h2>Fork Truck Warehouse Bessemer</h2>
<p>Capable of lifting 20,000 pounds, this is the latest of Load Lifter's high-visibility forklifts. The following tests are designed to verify rated capacities of Narrow-Aisle-Rider fork trucks having rated capacities up to and including 10,000 lb at 24-inch load center and to determine capacity or alternate rated capacities. If other tests or tests for trucks over 10,000 lb rated capacity are required, the details should be agreed upon between the interested parries.</p>
<p>Types include two-wheeled hand trucks, which require the load to be tilted during travel; three-or-more wheeled dollies have a platform but no handle, so the load is pushed; and manually-pushed floor hand trucks or carts that ride on four-or-more wheels and may or may not have a hitch for pulling or a handle for pushing. Prior to 2011 all States and Territories of Australia independently regulated occupational health and safety in that state, including forklift licensing.</p>
<p>Available in both manual and electric operated versions, pallet trucks come in different variants to suit desired applications. The load limit of the lift truck decreases as the load centre is raised. Your solution: a high-capacity electric forklift. If the truck is originally equipped with front end attachments, the truck nameplate shall also be marked to identify the attachments and show the approximate weight of the truck and attachment combination and capacity of the truck and attachment combination at maximum elevation of the load engaging means with load laterally centered.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the range also includes galvanised and stainless steel pallet jacks, ideal for use in the food and pharmaceutical industry where hygiene is central. Category includes box trucks, maintenance trucks, forklifts, tow trucks, flatbed trucks, electric carts. Wire guiding or rail guiding order pickers means that the lift truck can operate in an aisle as narrow as 54 inches.</p>
