<h2>Used Pallet Truck Millen</h2>
<p>Forklifts can actually be traced back to the late 1800's, but the modern forklift was developed in the 1960s by various companies including the transmission manufacturing company Clark and the hoist company Yale & Towne Manufacturing. This counterbalance (whether it's an actual weight or the forklift batteries found in an electric lift) is what offsets the load in front, accommodating weights from 3,000 to 120,000 lbs depending on the model selected.</p>
<p>When standard pallet sizes launched in 1930, forklifts became even more useful. However, to maximize the benefits you can gain from a short-term forklift rental, you need to understand lift truck rental agreements and how they align to the needs of your specific business. Affordability - Rental forklift is highly affordable; you can rent a high-capacity forklift at a very reasonable cost.</p>

Like the base model 3-wheel forklift, the basic 4-wheel capacity is 3,000 lb. But the difference between the two types of trucks is that 4-wheels don't quite have the maneuverability of 3-wheels.</p>
