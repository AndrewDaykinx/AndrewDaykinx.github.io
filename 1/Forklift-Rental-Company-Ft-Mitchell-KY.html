<p>That's why our focus is making the forklift rental process quick and easy, without the usual red tape and fine print of the big rental companies. The 37-inch-wide C-G chassis—about five to six inches narrower than the chassis of a typical 4,000 to 7,000 lb. forklift—allows C-G Series forklifts to navigate tight rack storage aisles.

The counterbalance forklift features two forks at the front and has the ability to drive up close to a load to pick it up and move it.

As someone with no forklift experience, you will do between three and six days of training before you take the test. Truck should be placed on an initially level test platform with the axis of the load wheels parallel to the tilting axis of the platform.</p>
<p>These abilities made rough terrain forklifts vital on farms and construction sites. This course has been designed to introduce workers to the forklift they'll be operating, what it's capable of, learn it's limitations, and train them on how to operate it properly. Growth of the Pallet Trucks market is predominantly driven by the development of large-scale industrial projects in developing economies of South East Asia Pacific, Middle East & Africa, India and China.</p>
