Take a test drive of a lifted GMC truck at our GMC dealership's headquarters as soon as you can. We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida. Since electric forklifts use a battery, there are no fuel costs; they operate a great deal more quietly than internal combustion engines and last longer than internal combustion engines because they have less moving parts.</p>
<p>We sell, rent and service a wide variety of forklift makes and models. United Rentals deploys over $11.6 billion of fleet. The auto loan experts at our Dallas lease department will make absolutely sure you can get the best rates on any Chevrolet Silverado lifted truck. In 2000, OSHA issued an ergonomics standard.

<p>When it's time to choose a supplier for your forklift needs, it's important to know that they take your questions and concerns seriously. An alternative to class 3s, tuggers can pull large loads without requiring the equipment to lift it off the ground to do it. This class is used on high traffic sites such as airport landing strips and luggage collection as they are easier to maneuver than a full forklift.</p>
<p>For others, it's the enhanced functionality and driver satisfaction that makes these trucks attractive choice. Standard forklifts have little ground clearance as they are predominantly operated on solid smooth surfaces such as concrete floors.

<p>Simply put, a pallet jack is a large tool used to lift and move heavy pallets.

We provide the best Warranty in the business and can offer outstanding Lease & Finance packages.</p>
<p>Even if repairs are necessary, a used forklift is cheaper to fix as the parts are less costly. The CASE H Series, for example, has a 45-degree forward tilt and 15-degree rear tilt; also, the mast collapses down during transport or when not lifting a load and then extends for a higher reach when in use. A lifted truck shows that there's more to a modern pickup than just its performance and tech features.</p>
