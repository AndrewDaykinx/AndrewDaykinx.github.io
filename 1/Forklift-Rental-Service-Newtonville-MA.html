<p>Considerations include forklift type, capacity, carriage type, and number of hydraulic functions (that power the attachment features). In the past most order picking jobs were carried out on ground level to increase the productivity, while stock was replenished to the bottom layer with reach & fork trucks.

<p>CENTER CONTROL: The operator control position is located near the center of the truck. Available for trucks and SUVs with as much as 12 inches of lift, Superlift is the brand to choose when replacing shocks trucks equipped with the tallest lift kits. Nowadays there are even automated guided vehicles (AGVs) and state-of-the-art robotic forklifts. A subtype of walkie stacker, the order picker forklift is operated to pick up and deliver units.</p>
