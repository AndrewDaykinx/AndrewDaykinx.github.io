In other words if you are unloading pallets from racking and your top beam is at 144” you will need a lift truck that has a maximum fork height of a few inches higher to ensure you will be able to lift pallet above the rack and then remove the pallet from the racks.</p>
<p>There are plenty of things to consider about how your truck will change after it's lifted. At Leson Chevrolet, we pride ourselves on being your lifted truck dealership in the Harvey and New Orleans area.
