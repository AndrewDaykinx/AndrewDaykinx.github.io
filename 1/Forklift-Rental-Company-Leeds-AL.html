The rough-terrain or straight-mast forklift has become more of a niche machine, rather than an ‘everybody-needs-one' machine,” says Charlie Detrich, U.S. sales & dealer development manager for Liftking.</p>
<p>The global Pallet Trucks market is anticipated to represent a huge incremental opportunity between 2018 and 2028.
