This allows our electric reach trucks to transport loads weighing up to 2.5 tons quickly and safely to their destination.

Counterbalanced forklifts have been a source of storage and handling systems, where they perform loading, stacking, distribution and horizontal transport functions. Renting is ideal for short-term jobs or situations where equipment needs may change quickly.</p>

The ZR2 has increased clearance, a transfer case shield, front frame-mounted tow hooks, and 17-inch wheels with Goodyear Wrangler DuraTrac maximum traction tires. There are different sized forklifts and you'll have to determine if you want a smaller or bigger sized equipment to handle all of the lifting.</p>
