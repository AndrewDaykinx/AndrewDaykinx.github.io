<p>Reach trucks have baselegs extending from the tractor to support the load. Some of the pallet trucks also independently reduce high speeds when cornering, adjust their drive behavior to the current situation, or help when climbing gradients. Rather than increasing the distance between the body and the frame, a suspension lift kit either replaces or adjusts the truck's leaf springs to lift its suspension.</p>

Although there are several different ways in which trucks can be lifted, most methods fall into one of two categories: body lifts and suspension lifts. Body lift kits give your tires more clearance while retaining factory suspension alignment and geometry. You'll also want bigger tires and may also add a ladder to make it easier to get in. Wheels and tires come in many sizes, and you'll choose the ones that will customize your pickup for its intended use or the look you're seeking.</p>
<p>Just like with tires, wheels are also rated to carry a load, and most ratings max out at a specific tire size. Loads may fall or forklifts can easily be turned over tilting moderate loads. This involves driving the pallet jack throughout the warehouse, collecting different products on the order sheet, and safely getting out of the warehouse to load the orders onto a truck or other shipping vehicle.</p>
