<p>Industrial counterbalance forklifts are the most common trucks used in indoor warehouses and stores. For pallet jacks that can weigh for dual efficiency, contact METTLER TOLEDO.

<h2>Forklifts Vs Pallet Jacks Rhome </h2>
<p>Despite being used, all of our rough terrain forklifts are of a high standard. However, forklift trucks come in a number of different sizes and models. Obviously the biggest difference between the two forklifts is the position of the operator. It's against the law for anyone to operate a counterbalance forklift or any type of powered industrial truck without OSHA-approved forklift training and certification.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many lift kits and the companies that sell and install them, fail to educate consumers about the differences in their vehicle's handling that can impact safety behind the wheel. Start searching our inventory of 700+ forklifts with just a few clicks. By implementing the scheme, we can reduce the number of vehicles on the road by 40%. Cat® lift trucks is one of the most trusted forklift brands in the world.</p>
