However, in both cases, these vehicles have to be operated by a person who can either sit or stand while operating the forklift.</p>

<p>The answers are also important for you to choose the correct forklift attachments to do the job at hand. Whether your team needs forklifts every day or on rare occasion, renting forklifts may be the best fiscal option.
