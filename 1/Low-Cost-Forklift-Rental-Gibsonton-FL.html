The reach forklift is capable of performing the same types of work as the counterbalance and can be fitted with attachments for special lifting jobs as required. When a 15,500 lb. forklift isn't enough, you'll need a high-capacity cushion forklift to get the job done.</p>
<p>Before settling on what forklift to purchase or rent, be certain you've got a good idea of the weights and dimensions of the loads you intend to lift. Its optimized design and quiet, stable mast allows for precise control of loads of all shapes and sizes, especially when used with a variety of attachments. OSHA tests you on properly driving forklifts. Product-line features: Each of the JCB rough-terrain forklifts is powered by a four-cylinder diesel engine generating 76 horsepower, driven for quick, smooth operation in all terrain by a JCB SyncroShuttle transmission.</p>
<p>The operator has to be aware of the forces bearing on the forklift as it turns corners. Comparable to the height capacity of a standard forklift, the outrigger legs on the front of the machine can support the load up to more than 30 feet.

<p>In addition, alternate rated capacities may be established at other load centers and other platform heights. It happens because the one side of the chain is fixed to the immovable frame of the forklift, and the only way by which masts can move upward is when gears rotate in clockwise direction and pull the forks overhead. Raising your truck can help making towing easier, as the increased ground clearance makes loading and unloading more accessible.</p>
<p>Rent a forklift with a configuration that makes you most productive. Conveniently mounted on the cowl, the hydraulic control levers allow the operator to gain access from the right or left side of the truck. Diesel forklifts are strongly recommended if the forklift will be used for heavy lifting or outdoors. Load-reach management devices can automatically restrict the reach of the forklift based on the load being handled rather than relying on the operator.</p>
