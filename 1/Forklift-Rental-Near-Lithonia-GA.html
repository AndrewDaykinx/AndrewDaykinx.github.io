The pump ''top-of-stroke'' hydraulic fluid bypass minimizes stress on the system when the load is raised to maximum lift height.</p>

Although a primitive pissing contest in the eyes of some, the lifted-truck community does get down and dirty in some sections; namely the mudder section.</p>
<p>Order picker forklifts are usually powered by electric motors because they don't generate noxious fumes. Product-line features: G Series rough-terrain forklifts are built with the same engine and power train as used in Case's backhoe-loaders, providing the tractive force required to work in muddy conditions or on sloped sites.
