<p>As well as Materials Handling equipment - covering London, Heathrow, Gatwick and surrounding areas. The thrill of navigating rough and rocky terrain can only be accomplished in a truck that has the right amount of ground clearance and larger tires. These types of forklifts are all hand controlled where the operator is in the front of the truck and controls the lift truck through a steering tiller.</p>
<p>In trucks where the operator is seated, a vertical clearance of at least 39 inches should be maintained from the point of maximum depression of the seat under the operator to the underside of the section of the guard under which the operator's head moves during normal operation. Trucks with suspension lifts tend to handle quite a bit different than factory models, not only due to the higher center of gravity but also because of the changes to the suspension.</p>

<p>Simply pick up the mobile unit with any kind of forklift or truck and drive wherever you need to go.
