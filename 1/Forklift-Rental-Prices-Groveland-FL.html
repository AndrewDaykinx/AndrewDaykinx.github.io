<h2>Fork Truck Warehouse Groveland</h2>

<p>Counterweight - a mass attached to the rear of the forklift truck frame.

<p>In addition to rentals, they also sell new and used equipment. You shouldn't ever buy forklifts that haven't had a Thorough Examinations test done, and you shouldn't purchase from a forklift sales dealer who doesn't know the ins and outs of lifting equipment.
