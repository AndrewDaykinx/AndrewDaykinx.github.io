<p>In an Order Picking Forklift the Operator goes up into the air with the load and either places pallets mechanically, or moves smaller loads on and off the order picker manually. Well, you're going to have to work a little bit harder than a 6” suspension lift to pimp your truck out, but it's still doable. Theoretically this is to increase off-road performance, although the higher center of gravity would likely make them more likely to roll over on rough terrain.</p>
<p>This Nationally Recognised and WorkSafe Victoria Accredited Unit allows you to perform work that requires a forklift truck high risk work (HRW) licence. Carefully consider lifting a brand new truck, as this can cause premature wear and added stress to critical components such as shocks, wheel bearings, suspension bushings, ball joints, and tie rods. When your load is sitting on pallets, the forklift prongs can fit easily into the pallet to move and carry your heavy load rapidly.</p>

These permit the truck to drive over bumpy terrain without harming the vehicle's under-body. This abrasion can reduce the thickness of a fork until it cannot lift loads up to the designed capacity.
