<p>These sorts of lifted trucks drive differently than stock models, due to the change of suspension and higher center of gravity, but can utilize mush larger tires than a factory model. Advances in machinery made life easier for warehouse personnel; one of these important innovations was the pallet jack, which is basically a type of forklift. Many of the most serious forklift accidents happen when a driver drops a payload.</p>
<p>OSHA requires that all forklift operators' performances be evaluated at least once every three years. With more than 50 models to choose from, our forklifts are manufactured with superior quality. This type of forklift is suited for uneven surfaces with its sturdy pneumatic tires. By applying air pressure to the lift axle, the driver is able to add one more axle into the equation and relieve some of the weight being supported by the other axles.</p>
<p>Electric forklifts don't generate polluting emissions, and although they are usually the most expensive to buy, they are the cheapest in terms of operating costs. All operators are required to wear a harness while operating any order picker at any height. Heli is China's number one manufacturer of forklifts and 6th largest in the world.
