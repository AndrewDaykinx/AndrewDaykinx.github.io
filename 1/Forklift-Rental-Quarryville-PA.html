<p>Towing: It's easier to tow heavier loads with a lifted truck since your truck won't be as at high of risk of bottoming out.

From lifting items into the shipping trucks to stocking things away in storage, their maneuverability lends well to various working environments and conditions.</p>

This course has been designed to introduce workers to the forklift they'll be operating, what it's capable of, learn it's limitations, and train them on how to operate it properly.
