<p>Forklifts can actually be traced back to the late 1800's, but the modern forklift was developed in the 1960s by various companies including the transmission manufacturing company Clark and the hoist company Yale & Towne Manufacturing.

Four-wheel-drive, also known as 4×4, is the hallmark of a vehicle built for off-road performance and on-road safety, and it has also become synonymous with the Jeep brand.</p>
<p>There are two main types of side loader forklifts, the enclosed cab that is most commonly used outdoors, and a stand up version that is more suited to indoor tasks. When placed on the forks, the center of the test weight shall be located on the longitudinal centerline of the truck. This online course is meant for forklift operators, site safety engineers and managers in charge of following job site safety regulations.</p>
