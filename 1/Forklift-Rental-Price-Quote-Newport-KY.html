<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>

Industrial Counterbalanced Forklift trucks have been used since the 1960's to aid in the transportations of heavy warehousing materials over short distances and heights.

<p>Class VII - Rough terrain forklift is a generic term used to describe forklifts typically intended for use on unimproved natural terrain and disturbed terrain construction sites. Also, 4,000 lb. trucks use a heavier battery to counteract the heavier load on the forks. The order selector operators ride up and down with the load and must be secured to the truck using a belt and tether system.</p>
<p>The pallet jack drop lever is often a small lever in the middle of the rounded handle, on the vertical stem of the manual machine. We specialise in NZ forklifts including electric forklifts, VNA forklifts and used forklifts for sale.
