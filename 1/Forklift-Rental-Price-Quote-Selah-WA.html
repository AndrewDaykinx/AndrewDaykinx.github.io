<p>Comprehensive training courses covering the safe and efficient operation of Industrial Reach Truck equipment for operators of all skills and experience.

Radnes Services Limited are London South's premier Caterpillar dealer offering the full range of material handling products to meet every requirement. The Company offers forklifts, lift trucks, dumpers, compactors, screeds, trowels, and telehandlers, as well as repairs and maintenance services.</p>
<p>These are Sit-down forklifts designed for indoor use with solid, cushioned tires — powered by internal-combustion (IC) engines that run on diesel fuel or, more commonly, LP gas. You don't want a truck that was lifted by some random mechanic since there is no guarantee the mechanic knows what he or she is doing. Since they can easily move from indoor to exterior jobs, these machines are remarkably flexible.</p>

<p>At our GMC dealership near Rocky Mount and Goldsboro in Wilson, we offer professional upgraded lifted GMC trucks. Forklifts use rear wheel steering. My "beater" 4WD has a 3" lift kit that gives it about a 10" minimum ground clearance-more than enough clearance to handle some quite nasty trails-but I actually use my 4WD for both work and pleasure in areas where such capability is a necessity.</p>
