Rentals are a repeat business - your customers only rent your equipment for a period of time, so if they need it again in the future they have to rent again. When you're looking to buy a forklift in Bristol, the first thing you should do is pick up the phone to us. It may well be that you already know exactly what you want, in which case we will provide you with a quote.</p>

A lifted truck can provide you with greater ground clearance beneath your truck, even if you choose a simple lift kit, which can help you with going off-road with your pickup.</p>
<p>Beyond that, many workers can also be injured when (1) lift trucks are inadvertently driven off loading docks; (2) lifts fall between docks and an unsecured trailer; (3) they are struck by a lift truck; or (4) they fall while on elevated pallets and tines. While gas forklift types do not need to charge and can operate day or night as long as they have enough fuel, battery operated forklifts need to be properly charged for up to eight hours to be used at maximum capacity.</p>
