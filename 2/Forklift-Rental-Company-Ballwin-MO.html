We also rent manual pallet jacks, electric carts, scissor lifts, ramps, and various forklift attachments such as rotators, clamps, carpet poles, and extensions.</p>

To avoid accidents, maintain a safe distance from other forklifts and pedestrians when the truck is elevated. Those who are operators must know this information before they start driving the forklift. As one of New England's top forklift distributors, NITCO maintains a huge new and used inventory of all the forklift types listed above.</p>
<p>Step into the forklift operator's seat and fasten the seatbelt. From the wide-open operator window to its rock solid stability system, Crown's SP Series forklifts are designed to help busy order pickers maintain confidence at height and efficiently handle a variety of tasks. As the name suggests, the reach forklift is primarily designed to pick up loads high in racking or storage.</p>
<p>When it is necessary to omit the overhead guard, special attention should be given by the user and operator to conditions such as height and stability of loads and stacks, weight of individual units, and operating space including overhead obstructions. Whether you use rough terrain forklifts every day or once in awhile, these machines can handle major wear and tear.</p>
<p>The higher its height limit is, the higher the price will probably be. Bucket trucks can offer aerial lifts that range from 34 to over 100 feet. Counterbalance forklifts are available in models powered by gasoline, batteries, propane, or diesel fuel. When your application requires the power of an internal combustion forklift, count on Crown to provide the right combination of strength, durability, operator comfort and application flexibility to meet your needs.</p>
