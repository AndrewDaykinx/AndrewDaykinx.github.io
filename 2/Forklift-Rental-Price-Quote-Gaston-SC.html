<p>Studies have shown that there are roughly 900,000 Rough Terrain Forklifts used every day in U.S. businesses. Citizens are free to install lift kits and after-market wheels, as well as grill guards, performance shocks, and after-market bumpers. The Industrial Truck Association (ITA, ) has defined seven classes of lift trucks, or forklifts, which are defined by the type of engine, work environment, operator position and equipment characteristics. In some cases, you may be looking to expand your business or take on work that requires equipment you don't have, like a forklift.</p>
<p>Reach trucks have baselegs extending from the tractor to support the load. Some of the pallet trucks also independently reduce high speeds when cornering, adjust their drive behavior to the current situation, or help when climbing gradients. Rather than increasing the distance between the body and the frame, a suspension lift kit either replaces or adjusts the truck's leaf springs to lift its suspension.</p>

<p>In addition to pallet jacks, you can also find numerous accessories and tools at TVH. UniCarriers, Clark Materials, and Yale manufacture some of the most high-quality reach forklifts.

<p>If the operator must frequently enter and exit the forklift to access product, build pallets, etc. Ask what kind of lift it is, who installed it and if there have been any problems with it. Most lifted trucks are bought used so bring along a flash light and inspect the truck for crusted mud in the vehicle's nooks and crannies. Stand-up forklifts (also known as stand-on and electric riders) are designed for applications where the operator must get on and off the lift truck frequently.</p>
<p>We only sell forklifts that we are confident to be a great value for the condition it is in. Through our connections and many resources, we are always adding units to our inventory, giving you a wide selection of makes and models to suit the needs of your operation.

<p>If you have concerns about lifted trucks and you just want something from the factory that is great for going off-road, then either of these models is a great choice. Like the base model 3-wheel forklift, the basic 4-wheel capacity is 3,000 lb. But the difference between the two types of trucks is that 4-wheels don't quite have the maneuverability of 3-wheels.</p>
