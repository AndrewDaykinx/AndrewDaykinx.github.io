An overhead guard is intended to offer protection from the impact of small packages, boxes, bagged material, etc., representative of the job application, but not to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load.

<p>116 Effective Powered Industrial Truck Operator Training Program Four major areas of concern must be addressed:  The general hazards that apply to the operation of all or most powered industrial trucks;  The hazards associated with the operation of particular types of trucks;  The hazards of workplaces generally; and,  The hazards of the particular workplace where the vehicle operates.</p>
<p>In trucks where the operator is seated, a vertical clearance of at least 39 inches should be maintained from the point of maximum depression of the seat under the operator to the underside of the section of the guard under which the operator's head moves during normal operation. Trucks with suspension lifts tend to handle quite a bit different than factory models, not only due to the higher center of gravity but also because of the changes to the suspension.</p>
