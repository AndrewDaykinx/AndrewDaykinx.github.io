Counterbalance forklifts are very versatile and are available in three or four wheeled models, have two forks protruding from the front of the machine, and have a counterbalance weight in the back of the truck to ensure loads don't create an imbalance.</p>
<p>They offer numerous models that can suit any materials handling job. Order pickers work best in warehouses that operate for library archival storage, retail applications and furniture picking. Different forklifts are made for different loading capacity and height of pallet racks.
