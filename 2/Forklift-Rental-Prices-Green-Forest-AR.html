<p>However, just like a stock vehicle, some components in a lift kit can wear out over time, most notably the shock absorbers Some lift kits include shocks that are radically different from the stock units, meaning that replacing those shocks isn't always as simple as just looking your vehicle up.

<p>As a legacy global provider of forklift trucks, we have in-depth knowledge of the industry and are able to offer a level of support that is unmatched in today's marketplace. Air Lift on-board air compressor systems will let you inflate and deflate your air springs from inside your cab or outside your vehicle. Therefore, tires that rub at stock height will still rub with a torsion twist somewhere in the suspension travel.</p>
<p>And because body lift kits don't significantly modify the entire suspension, you're left with a high center of gravity and poor ways of dealing with death wobble. OSHA defines powered industrial trucks (PITs) as any mobile power-propelled vehicle that is used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, and that can be ridden or controlled by a walking operator (see Forklift Classification Explained,‚Äù below).</p>
