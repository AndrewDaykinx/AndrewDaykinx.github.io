A brief discussion of the various types of forklifts on the market can help you to understand why answering the above questions first is essential to ensure you get the right equipment for the job.</p>
<p>Here's how it works: to create a lifted truck, you take a normal truck (which was developed for agricultural purposes but is now primarily used to see over minivans in traffic) and you put a "lift kit" on it. I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
<p>Guide rails, or electronic (or similar) guidance are suggested when lift trucks are operating in an area only used for stock pickers, side loaders, or order pickers. With rental, you know and control your forklift budget in advance and optimise operating costs by adjusting your fleet size to the minimum number of units needed.
