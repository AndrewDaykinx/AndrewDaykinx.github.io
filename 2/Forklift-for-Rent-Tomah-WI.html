<p>Offering a cabin for all weather conditions, and with Toyota SAS as standard, our 8-Series engine powered forklifts are ideal for outdoor use. This program discusses common hazards presented by the operation of reach trucks and how to control those hazards through safe operating techniques. Forklifts built in countries such as Iran or Russia will typically have no emission control systems.</p>
<p>With FLC's training, they'll learn how to properly and safely drive both regular and three-wheel counterbalance lifts, maneuver their way through tight spaces, properly handle and travel with heavy loads and avoid collisions, falling objects and other types of accidents. Don't pay for a 5,000 lb. capacity truck to move 2,000 lbs. If it is not meant for roller chain pulleys then forklifts would require much taller cylinders to lift up the load to an equivalent height.</p>
