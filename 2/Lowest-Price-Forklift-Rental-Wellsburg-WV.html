From electric pallet jacks to narrow aisle lift trucks or sit-down rider forklifts, we'll help you find exactly what you need and get it to your facility when you need it. Any surface a forklift drives on must be able to support the forklift and its load with a safety factor of four. If you intend to go beyond a short-term rental, consider talking with your local MCFA lift truck dealer first to make sure you get the most out of your forklift rental.</p>
<p>Gap guards are used to fill in this area and make these lifted trucks look better.

The baselegs and stand-up configuration of the tractor allow reach trucks to be used in aisles as narrow as 9 feet.
