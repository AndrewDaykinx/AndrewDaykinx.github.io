Ask your Raymond Handling Concepts Sales Rep about new, used or rental availability of order pickers.</p>

<p>The answers are also important for you to choose the correct forklift attachments to do the job at hand. Whether your team needs forklifts every day or on rare occasion, renting forklifts may be the best fiscal option. Green Spaces: Since rough terrain forklifts can handle loose ground and can move backfill, they work well in green spaces.

<p>These rough terrain forklifts come with a higher ground clearance that is crucial to work on cross-country terrain.

But work can go a lot quicker if you have the right equipment to help you out—and pallet jack is one of the most convenient and efficient types of equipment out there for the job.</p>
