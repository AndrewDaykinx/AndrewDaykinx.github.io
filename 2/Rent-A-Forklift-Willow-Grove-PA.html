<p>9. 9 Scope of Standard (continued) For marine terminal and longshoring industries, all powered industrial trucks are covered, no matter what specialized name they are given. Toyota's 6BWC20 is ideal for 4,000 lb loads, while Jungeinrich's EMC 110 is suited for narrow aisles.

While gas forklift types do not need to charge and can operate day or night as long as they have enough fuel, battery operated forklifts need to be properly charged for up to eight hours to be used at maximum capacity.</p>
