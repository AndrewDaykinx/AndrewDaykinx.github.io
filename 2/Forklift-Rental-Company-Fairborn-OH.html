<p>A truck that has had its suspension modified so that it rides way too far off the ground, usually to the point where the high center of gravity could actually be dangerous. The Pivot Steer Forklift Truck is commonly used in industry both inside of a warehouse and is ideal for very narrow aisle work as the mast can be rotated 90° to either side of the truck. It keeps some of the ride characteristics you love from the factory Jeep Wrangler spring while improving the off-road performance. We have an expansive inventory of pre-owned forklifts from Hyster, Taylor, Yale, Toyota, Caterpillar, Hoist, Kalmar, TCM and other leading brands.</p>
<p>Whether tough outdoor use or classic stacking in the warehouse; whether pallet truck, order picker or narrow aisle truck; if you need to move a few hundredweight or several tons - at Jungheinrich Rental you always get the right truck.

We are your source for the best daily, weekly, or monthly prices on rentals including Cat, Hyster, and Toyota brands.</p>

We take care of the maintenance of all of our rental forklifts for you. With their stronger frames, they can lift heavier loads higher than forklifts that operate in warehouses, for example. The Rocky Ridge K2 package includes a 6-inch suspension lift, custom fender flares, 20-inch custom wheels, 35-inch all-terrain tires, and Rocky Ridge exclusive stealth-coated grille and bumpers.</p>
