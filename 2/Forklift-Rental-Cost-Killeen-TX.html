<p>Quality parts for all lift trucks and all lift truck needs. If a truck is lifted for functional reasons and it actually functions better it's an improvement.

<p>While they move heavy loads and increase efficiency, forklifts can also cause serious injuries when they are used unsafely. Those are the vehicles that you will need to test drive before making a decision. OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.178 covering PITs requires employers to develop and implement a training program based on the general principles of safe truck operation.</p>
<h2>Know More About Forklift Training Killeen </h2>
<p>If you purchased a truck with a lift kit and you're not certain of its lift height, you'll need to measure the difference between the factory ride height (found in your truck's service manual) and its current ride height. In the 1940s, forklifts became even easier to use, thanks to batteries that drivers could recharge. Because of the nature of their work and the environments in which they operate, using rough terrain forklifts can also pose numerous hazards.</p>
<p>While maintaining a small turning radius, the P Series machines are built to a 22,000-pound capacity, and even larger as specifically required. Atlantic Training's "Forklift Safety: Industrial Counterbalance Lift Trucks" training program has been designed to introduce employees to the forklift they'll be using, explain its capabilities and limitations, and show them how to operate and maintain it properly.</p>
