<p>Virtually any standard sized truck can be lifted to a certain extent or another. Some pallet jack models are able to lift loads all the way up to 15,000 pounds (6,803 kg). The forklift and load must be considered a unit with a continually varying center of gravity with every movement of the load. The pallet truck is simply for moving loads from one place to another at ground level, but it has limited reach, while the lift truck is more complex and is capable of transporting and lifting a palletised load onto a higher level or for stacking loads on top of each other.</p>
<p>This mainly due to the growing demand for material handling equipment across the manufacturing industry. The 8,000 lb. electric 4-wheel is used in higher capacity operations.

<p>Understand the causes of instability of the truck and loads. We're always out looking for a great deal on a pre-owned forklift, so that we can be the main source you look to when you are wanting to purchase one. Overall, a sit-down forklift is the right call for operations that need several hours of forklift work a day, or need to put their operator's comfort, safety, and accessibility first.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you.

If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
