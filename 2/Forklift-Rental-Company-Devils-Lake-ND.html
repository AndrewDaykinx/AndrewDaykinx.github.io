According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ), the three most common types of forklift injuries happen when: 1) A forklift rolls or overturns.

Forklifts come in many sizes, shapes, colors and functions. Rough terrain forklifts are larger, stronger and more durable and hence they are pricey than the average forklift. Its stabilized legs and forward extending forks enables this warehouse truck to extend upwards to reach racks that are usually too high for a standard forklift.</p>
