<p>Forklifts are powered industrial trucks used to lift and move materials in short distances. Operators get excellent visibility with panoramic views of rack, loads and aisle. Therefore, a truck's suspension has to be lifted and its components adjusted so everything fits and works well.

<p>Charges will continue until the equipment is returned to the rental supplier and the equipment is available to be rented to the next customer.
