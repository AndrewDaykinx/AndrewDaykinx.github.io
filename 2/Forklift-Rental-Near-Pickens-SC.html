<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>These are Sit-down forklifts designed for indoor use with solid, cushioned tires — powered by internal-combustion (IC) engines that run on diesel fuel or, more commonly, LP gas.
