<p>The larger models use a telescoping boom with lift capacities up to 10,000 pounds (4,540 kg), vertical reaches up to 40 feet (12 m) and forward reaches of 25 feet (7 m) or more. Lencrow Forklifts has a range of new electric-powered order pickers to suit each operator style and handling application.

<p>Safety features of this forklift truck include a high-visibility overhead guard, an emergency power disconnect switch, electric horn, and an anti-static ground strap. Manual pallet jacks have existed since at least 1918. Heavy loads and the shifting center-of-gravity can tip a forklift over if it goes too fast. For intricate indoor operations, reach forklift trucks can provide drivers with another set of eyes when they are handling a robust inventory.</p>
<p>In the context of attachment, a hydraulic function consists of a valve on the forklift with a lever near the operator that provides two passages of pressurized hydraulic oil to power the attachment features.

These forklifts can drive under 8 foot passages, and come in two-wheel, four-wheel, and four-wheel crab steering (all wheels are able to turn).</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
