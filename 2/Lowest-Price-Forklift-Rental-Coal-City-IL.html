<p>A forklift is a type of material handling lift that has two prongs attached to the front of it. These prongs look like a tuning fork and assist in the lifting of objects.

<p>Rough terrain forklifts have four-wheel power steering, but it can be changed into two-wheel as well. The Raymond 4460 sit down forklift features a low profile and excellent operator visibility for exceptional performance and productivity in confined spaces.
