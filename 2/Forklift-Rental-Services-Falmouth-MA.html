<p>Forklift is a small industrial vehicle, having a power operated forked platform attached at the front that can be raised and lowered for insertion under a cargo to lift or move it. Forklifts serve the needs of various industries including warehouses and other large storage facilities. In the United States, approximately one person is killed in a forklift accident every 3 days on average. Therefore, the driving experience behind the wheel of cheap used lifted trucks for sale is unlike anything else. Class 4 forklift, primarily used indoors on smooth surfaces, commonly warehouse operations transporting 2,000 - 90,000lbs. Just knowing the challenges associated with a lifted vehicle can help you increase safety in and around your truck.</p>
<p>Reliable and easy-to-use, our all-terrain forklifts for hire provide great performance for your workplace. The first reason is obvious Sun Equipment does not want you to purchase the wrong used forklift for sale or spend more than you need on a used forklift with features that you will never use. For anyone who is an adventurous individual or need a truck with significant size and power, then you really have to test drive one of our lifted trucks.</p>
<h2>Truck Mounted Forklifts Falmouth </h2>

This is because the forks are mounted to the side of the truck and can pick up wide or long loads that would be awkward or inaccessible with a straight forward forklift.</p>
