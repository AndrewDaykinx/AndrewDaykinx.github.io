<p>Typically, these types of vehicles are known as forklifts or lift trucks. When you buy a pallet truck then you will come across many varieties in the market. It is common for indoor electric forklifts to use cushion tires. Rough terrain forklifts are essential material handling equipment on many worksites. A different type of forklift is to be used.
