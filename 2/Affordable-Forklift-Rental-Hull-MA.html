Counterbalance forklift is characterized by its stability with the low center of gravity in its structure. Many manufacturers opt for watertight wheel bearings, a hydraulic elevator or a built-in pump to ensure their rough terrain pallet jacks are easy and comfortable to use, even in the harshest conditions.</p>
<p>7. Teletrucks - Short for telescopic hander forklift, these devices are another option for users that are tasked with high lifting or facilitation of mezzanine storage. There will be a gap between the body and the frame of the truck, which can be covered with a gap guard to protect the exposed mechanicals.Suspension lifts are used to get that super-mega-monster truck look.</p>
<p>Driving such a mess would be grounds for ridicule and a reminder that the driver is a low-class yokel redneck from the uncultured fly-over states.

Frequency of use and pallet transport distance should be taken into consideration when choosing between manual and electric pallet trucks.</p>
