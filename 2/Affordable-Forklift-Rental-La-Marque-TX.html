<p>At the time, Vincent Halma, president and CEO of KION North America, said the rate at which we're releasing new products and services is truly unprecedented.” KION also recently announced plans to expand its South Carolina facility capacity to 12,000 lift trucks a year by 2020, up from 3,000 in 2015. The most obvious benefit is the increased ground clearance when driving over rugged terrain, which reduces the risk of damage to your undercarriage.</p>

Industrial counterbalance lift trucks are the forklifts that do most of the materials handling work in industrial facilities today.

Most trucks on the market today are built with what is commonly referred to as a body-on-frame design; the frame is built for the engine, drivetrain, and suspension, then a separate body is attached to the frame.</p>

<h3>Portable Lifting Equipment La Marque TX 77568</h3>

We offer complete warehouse equipment solutions including warehouse design, warehouse storage, layout, conveyors, pallet rack, cantilever rack, dock equipment and repair, as well as scissor lift tables. The PTH hand pallet truck with powered scissor lift can be electrically raised to a maximum work height of 800 mm, avoiding unnecessary bending and heavy lifting.</p>
<p>When leaving a powered industrial truck unattended, load engaging means shall be fully lowered, controls shall be neutralized, power shut off, brakes set, key of connector plug removed.
