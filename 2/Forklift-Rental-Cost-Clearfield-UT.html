Commonly found on port loading docks, scrap yards and recycling plants, and within an endless variety of other industrial applications, there is one consistency among every rough terrain forklift: versatility. Each is designed to work within extreme environments, natural landscapes, and the uneven ground often found on construction sites.</p>
<p>Forklifts weigh thousands of lbs. For true off-road operations requiring superior traction, there are also four-wheel drive rough-terrain forklifts.
