Four-wheel-drive is usually a selectable system designed to give better performance on broken terrain in low grip road conditions. A lifted truck can provide you with greater ground clearance beneath your truck, even if you choose a simple lift kit, which can help you with going off-road with your pickup.</p>
<p>Lifting your trucks suspension does not directly cause more stress on your wheels or tires.

Give us a call at 800-836-3882 if you have any questions or are interested in learning additional information about these trucks.
